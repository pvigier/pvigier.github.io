<p>A part of my projects are hosted on GitHub. You can find them on my <a href="https://github.com/pvigier">page</a>.</p>

<p>I won't describe my old projects there but I think I will make a blog post for my future projects !</p>

<p>I am currently working on two projects. The first one is a school project at Sup√©lec (France). We are working on recurrent neural networks and LSTM. You can find some of our codes and results <a href="https://github.com/supelec-lstm">here</a>. There are two teams on this project, I am a member of the team called "appartement".</p>

<p>The other one is a personal/professional project. With a friend, we are making a video game called "The Deviant Folks". It will be an open RPG where freedom and AI will have an important place. Stay tuned, I will soon blog about it.</p>
